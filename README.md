## General Purpose Chatbot 

In this project, we try to create a general purpose chatbot based on Cornell Movie Corpus Dataset. This project was done as a part of Udemy Deep Learning NLP A-Z course. The chatbot was built with attention and beam search decoding incorporated.

The Jupyter notebook with chatbot model can be found [here](https://github.com/abishekarun/Attention-based-Chatbot/blob/master/chatbot.ipynb).
