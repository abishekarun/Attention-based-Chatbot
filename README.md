## General Purpose Chatbot 

In this project, we try to create a general purpose chatbot based on Cornell Movie Corpus Dataset.The chatbot was built with attention and beam search decoding incorporated.

The Jupyter notebook with chatbot model can be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/abishekarun/Attention-based-Chatbot/blob/master/chatbot.ipynb). The results are not great as the model was run only for 20 epochs. We might get much better results if we run the model for 1000-2000 epochs.
